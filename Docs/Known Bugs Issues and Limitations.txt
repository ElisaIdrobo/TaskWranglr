Known Bugs Issues and Limitations(last updated 11/22/16)


Scheduling Algorithm:
	cannot handle tasks that have a time to complete that is longer than the time before the deadline		

Updating schedule:
	schedule does not update after a new event is added to a calendar
	schedule does not update after a task is updated
	crashes if calendar access is not given and a new event is added from the schedule view

Other:
	sometimes crashes at first ever startup with an error accessing the source of the devices calendar. Restarting app fixes it.



Not Yet Implemented:
	using subtasks in the scheduling algorithm
	viewing/dismissing task events 
	using a subset of calendars the user specifies to use in the schedule
