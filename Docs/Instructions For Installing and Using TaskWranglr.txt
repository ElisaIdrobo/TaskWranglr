TaskWranglr is an iOS app written in Swift 2.2 (XCode 7.3)

To run in the XCode Simulator, locate and open TaskWranglr/TaskWranglr/TaskWranglr.xcodeproj 
In the upper left is a run button.

There is a current bug where the app sometimes crashes at the first ever start up. If this happens restart the app.
Note: When changing the calendar access of TaskWranglr in settings restarts the app. When running in the simulator this halts the debugger and the app must be started again.

TaskWranglr needs access to  user calendars for its scheduling functionality, if access is not given the scheduling functionality is disabled.
